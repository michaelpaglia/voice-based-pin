ICSI 471/571 Spring 2024: Final Project

Option 5 (Image processing for 1D signal): Spectrogram offers a visual representation for 1D signals such as speech, music and audio. If you want to play with 1D signals (e.g., speech recognition or music instrument classification), you can use spectrogram-based representations to leverage the image processing tools. See if you can develop a speech-to-text interface for ten numbers (e.g., voice-based PIN).
