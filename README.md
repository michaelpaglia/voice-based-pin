ICSI 471/571 Spring 2024: Final Project

The objectives of this final project include:

1) Further improve your MATLAB programming and problem-solving skills through working with partners and supervisor (your instructor);

2) Develop a team-working spirit and understand the strength/weakness of your partners (1+1>2);

3) Explore some R&D opportunity related to CSI471 (mini-capstone design project);

4) Train salesmanship especially the vision of seeing beyond technical problems (why is your work important to others?).

Detailed timeline:

Week 1: team forming (3-5 person), problem selection, and dataset preparation

Week 2-3: ideas, surveys, data collection and planning

Week 4-7: implementation, debugging and polishing

Week 8: wrap-up and final presentations (in LC12, 1:00pm-3:00pm, May 7th)

During weeks 4-7, I will allocate Sunday Zoom hours to have online meetings with each team to discuss the project progress and offer technical help if needed.



Option 5 (Image processing for 1D signal): Spectrogram offers a visual representation for 1D signals such as speech, music and audio. If you want to play with 1D signals (e.g., speech recognition or music instrument classification), you can use spectrogram-based representations to leverage the image processing tools. See if you can develop a speech-to-text interface for ten numbers (e.g., voice-based PIN).
